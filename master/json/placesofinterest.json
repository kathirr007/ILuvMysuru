The peaks of these lofty range rise as high as 1800 m (BR hills 1400 to 1800 m; MM Hills 1000 to 1200 m). The highest hill is Kattari Betta, at 1800 MSL.

Later the Wodeyars Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore who were ardent devotees of Lord Venugopala displayed keen interest in maintaining the hill temple. The temple is dedicated to Gopalaswamy, which is one of the names of the Hindu God Krishna. The gopuram of the temple is single-tiered and rests on the compound wall of the enclosure. A dhwajastambha (flag-pillar) and a bali-peetam(sacrificial altar) is present in the mukha mantapa (inner-porch). The parapet wall of the mukha mantapa contains the sculpture of dashavatara (the avatars of the Hindu God Vishnu) with the center portion of the sculpture depicting Krishnavatara (the Avatar of Vishnu in which he appeared as Krishna). There is a shikhara tower over the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The garbha griha contains an idol of Krishna holding a flute under a tree. Krishna is flanked by his friends and the posture is that of a dance with the left big toe resting on the right one.

It is also said that when Sita Mata was tired and weary and wanted to have a bath, Lord Ram directed Lakshman to fire an arrow at a rock, once Lakshmana fired the arrow, water in 3 different shades started pouring out, one with turmeric, one with oil and one with shikakai (fruit for hair - natural shampoo). These shades are visible even today when there is considerable amount of water flowing in the falls.

The waterfall is caused by a check dam that exists over the Cauvery River. As the river takes a right turn near the site where the waterfall exists, it is called Balmuri. In the Kannada language Bala means &lsquo;right&rsquo; and Muri means &lsquo;curve&rsquo;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The check dam has been constructed across the river to act as a wall that tries to stop the flow of water. This is done to hold the water of the Cauvery River in order to feed the many irrigation canals that flow out of this location. When the check dam becomes filled with water to the brim, the water overflows to from a long and wonderful cascade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The check dam has a total length of 1.6 km. At a particular spot the check dam has a step with a height of about 6 feet. When the water falls over this area it resembles a mini waterfall. In light of such facts Balmuri is not a conventional waterfall and the gushing down of water found in natural waterfalls is missing at this place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is a wonderful place to enjoy the water and the lush green natural beauty surrounding the area.&lt;br&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"29/08/2016-01:26:40 PM","modified_date":"29/09/2016-04:13:09 PM"},{"placeid":"39d2b35a81625b47","title":"Jaganmohan Palace and Art Gallery","galleries":[{"id":383,"img_name":"715b7473be7530c3-0-jaganmohan-palace1.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/715b7473be7530c3-0-jaganmohan-palace1.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/715b7473be7530c3-0-jaganmohan-palace1.jpg"},{"id":384,"img_name":"715b7473be7530c3-1-Jaganmohan-Palace-Mysore.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/715b7473be7530c3-1-Jaganmohan-Palace-Mysore.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/715b7473be7530c3-1-Jaganmohan-Palace-Mysore.jpg"}],"tag_words":"Palace,Art Gallery,Restoration,Architecture,Auditorium","address":"Opp City Bus Stand, Jagan Mohan Palace Road, Chamrajpura, Mysuru, Karnataka 570024","lati":"12.30689","longi":"76.64931","ratingstar":4,"nearkm":"1","nearestplace":"Mysore Palace\r\nRailway Museum\r\nMysore Zoo\r\nMall of Mysore","details":"Jaganmohan Palace is a palace in Mysuru which was constructed in the year 1861 and was initially used by the Wodeyars, kings of Mysuru as their home.

It thus became a prominent centre of the Srivaishnava sect of Brahmins, who obtained from the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, who had become a follower of the Acharya, an assignment of the fertile tracts of land in the neighbourhood, especially of the Ashta Gramas, on either bank of the Cauvery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Important Places:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other shrines of Ramanuja, images of Alvars and Yadugiriammanavaru etc., in the temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the top of the hill is the impressive temple of Yoganarasimha. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III presented a gold crown to this upper shrine. There is a big pond there. Many more shrines and ponds are located in the town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melukote has been a centre of learning. It has contributed many literary figures, such as Tirumalarya, Chikkupadhyaya, Alasingachar and Pu. Ti. Narasimhachar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Vedavedantha Bodhini Sanskrit College is one of the oldest institutions here, established in 1854. An old library founded in 1935, contains large number of Samskrita, Tamil, Kannada, and Telugu books and manuscripts. In 1976, opening in 1978, a research institute, the Samskrita Academy was established, which incorporated the library.[1]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yathirajamatha, Ahobalamatha and Parakalamatha of the Srivaishnava sect are located in the place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melukote has been known for quality handlooms especially weaving dhoties, sarees, etc. An artisans training centre, a dairy unit and a residential school are established in the place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a vast forest land near this place and a wild life sanctuary is opened on 17 June 1974, to protect the species like wolves and black buck which are plenty in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The principal temple is a square building of large dimensions but very plain, dedicated to Lord Cheluva-Narayana Swamy or Thirunarayana. The utsavamurthi, which is a metallic image, represents the deity who is called Shelvapillai, Cheluva Raya and Cheluvanarayana Swamy, whose original name appears to have been Ramapriya (meaning Rama's Favourite). It is believed that this utsavamurthi belonged to and was worshipped by Lord Rama and the kings of the surya vamsa Dynasty for generations. Later the same deity was given to a king of Chandra vamsam (the dynasty of Lord Krishna) and was worshipped by Lord Krishna and many generations. So CheluvaNarayana is so unique that he was worshipped by both Rama and Krishna. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vairamudi Brahmotsava (Vairamudi Utsav) is an annual spiritual event and festival revered throughout South India. In the past it has attracted up to 400,000 devotees of Lord Cheluva Narayana (Tirunarayana). The main event is the procession of Lord Cheluvanarayana Swamy (as represented by an idol, normally in most srivaishnava temples, the presiding deit moolavar is represented on procession by utsavar in a different name, here Cheluvaraya is called as sampathkumara) through the streets of Melkote, which are decorated in his honour. In the procession the Lord's idol is carried on a golden garuda, along with idols representing his divine consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi. The procession takes place at night and continues until dawn. The festival is named for the legendary diamond studded crown, the Vaira Mudi,[6] which the Lord only wears during this procession. For the rest of the festival the Lord wears the Rajamudi, another crown studded with precious stones.&lt;br&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"27/08/2016-05:12:10 PM","modified_date":"04/10/2016-10:42:05 AM"},{"placeid":"044916083e254848","title":"Talakadu","galleries":[{"id":164,"img_name":"044916083e254848-0-IMG_2451.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/044916083e254848-0-IMG_2451.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/044916083e254848-0-IMG_2451.jpg"},{"id":165,"img_name":"044916083e254848-1-Sri-Vaidyanatheshwara-Temple-of-Talakad.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/044916083e254848-1-Sri-Vaidyanatheshwara-Temple-of-Talakad.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/044916083e254848-1-Sri-Vaidyanatheshwara-Temple-of-Talakad.jpg"},{"id":395,"img_name":"f074e8684a4d5218-0-13-templestructure.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/f074e8684a4d5218-0-13-templestructure.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/f074e8684a4d5218-0-13-templestructure.jpg"},{"id":396,"img_name":"f074e8684a4d5218-1-118969235.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/f074e8684a4d5218-1-118969235.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/f074e8684a4d5218-1-118969235.jpg"},{"id":397,"img_name":"f074e8684a4d5218-2-tk6.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/f074e8684a4d5218-2-tk6.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/f074e8684a4d5218-2-tk6.jpg"}],"tag_words":"Architecture, Cauvery River","address":"Talakadu, Karnataka 571122","lati":"12.194678","longi":"77.030539","ratingstar":4,"nearkm":"47.9","nearestplace":"Malangi\r\nThadimalangi\r\nGargeshwari\r\nSosale","details":"Talakadu is a desert-like town on the left bank of the Kaveri river 45 km (28 miles) from Mysore and 133 km (82 miles) from Bangalore in Karnataka, India. It once had over 30 temples, most of which now lay buried in sand. The extant group of temples, where the eastward flowing Kaveri river changes course as the sand on its banks spreads over a wide area, is a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Talakad sand covers the temples. Stone pillars, square at the base and made to fit into a wheel below the abacus, lie scattered about. Among the temples of Talakad, the Pathaleshwara, Maruleshwara, Arkeshwara, Vaidyanatheshwara and Mallikarjuna temples, the five Lingams believed to represent the five faces of Shiva, form the Pancha pathi and have become famous. In honour of these five Shiva temples, a fair is held once every 12 years called Panchalinga Darshana, last held in 2009. The Panchalinga Darshana is held on a new moon day in the month of Karthika when two stars conjoin, the stars of Khuha Yoga and Vishaka. On this day, tradition has it that pilgrims should first bathe in the Gokarna theertham, worship Gokarneswara and Chandikadevi, and then worship Vaidyeshwara, and then bathe in the northern eastern southern and western stretches of the Kaveri and then worship Arkeshwara, Pataleshwara, Maraleshwara and Mallikarjuna, returning to Vaidyeshwara after each worship, finally worship Kirtinarayana and conclude the pilgrimage in one day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to local legend, Ramanujacharya during his sojourn in Karnataka (also called Melnadu), established five Vishnu temples of Lord Narayana known as Pancha Narayana Kshetrams. Talakad is one of the Pancha Narayana Kshetrams where the Keerthi Narayana temple was established and the presiding Deity in this temple is Keerthi Narayana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;History&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Close up view of the shrine and mantapa (hall) outer wall at Vaidyeshvara temple&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The origin of the town is lost in antiquity; but one tradition is that its name was derived from two Kirata twin brothers, Tala and Kadu, who, cutting down a tree which they saw wild elephants worshiping, discovered that it contained an image of shiva, and that the elephants were rishis transformed. The tree being miraculously restored, all obtained moksha and the place was named Tala-kadu, which was translated into Sanskrit as Dala-vana. Two stone images declared to represent the brothers are pointed out in front of the temple Veerabadra swamy. In a later age, Rama is said to have halted here on his expedition to Lanka.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The earliest authentic mention of the city of Talekad or Talakadu, in Sanskrit Dalavana-pura, is in connection with the Ganga line of kings. Harivarma, who has been assigned to find a place (247-266 A.D) was, according to an old chronicle, installed at Skandapura (said to be Gajalhatti, in the Coimbatore country, near where the Moyar flows into the Bhavani), but resided in the great city of Dalavanapura in the Karnata-desa. Thenceforward Talkad became the capital these powerful sovereigns and there the subsequent kings of that line were crowned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the beginning of the 11th century, the Gangas succumbed to the Cholas, who captured Talkad and gave it the name of Rajarajapura. But about a hundred years later it was taken by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, who drove the Cholas out of Mysore. After this time we find that Talkad was composed of seven towns and five mathas or monastic establishments. The town of Mayilangi or Malingi, on the opposite side of the river, was also a large place, and had the name of Jananathapura. Down to the middle of the 14th century, it remained a possession of the Hoysalas, and then passed into the hands of a feudatory of the Vijayanagar sovereigns, whose line appears to be known as that of Soma-Raja.","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"27/08/2016-05:06:45 PM","modified_date":"29/09/2016-03:20:44 PM"},{"placeid":"15fb4dfd4cb2ffa8","title":"Shivanasamudra Falls","galleries":[{"id":398,"img_name":"565178d6194d15c2-0-30bg_bgsat_Shim_30_2392560f.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/565178d6194d15c2-0-30bg_bgsat_Shim_30_2392560f.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/565178d6194d15c2-0-30bg_bgsat_Shim_30_2392560f.jpg"},{"id":399,"img_name":"565178d6194d15c2-1-IMG_7108-2.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/565178d6194d15c2-1-IMG_7108-2.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/565178d6194d15c2-1-IMG_7108-2.jpg"},{"id":400,"img_name":"565178d6194d15c2-2-IMG_7145-2.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/565178d6194d15c2-2-IMG_7145-2.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/565178d6194d15c2-2-IMG_7145-2.jpg"},{"id":401,"img_name":"565178d6194d15c2-3-jog-falls.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/565178d6194d15c2-3-jog-falls.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/565178d6194d15c2-3-jog-falls.jpg"}],"tag_words":"Cauvery River, Falls, Forest","address":"Shivanasamudra, Karnataka","lati":"12.299748","longi":"77.177274","ratingstar":3,"nearkm":"76.6","nearestplace":"Gaganachukki Falls\r\nBharachukki Falls\r\nMuthathi\r\nTalakadu\r\nKollegal","details":"Shivasamudra is a small city in the Mandya District of the state of Karnataka, India.

The temple was built by the Ganga dynasty rulers of the area in the 9th century; the structure was strengthened and improved upon architecturally some three centuries later. Thus, the temple is a medley of the Hoysala and Vijayanagar styles of temple architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although situated a mere 15 km from Mysore city, Srirangapatna lies in the neighbouring district of Mandya. The entire town is enclosed by the river Kaveri to form a river island, northern half of which is shown in the image to the right. While the main river flows on the eastern side of the island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradition holds that all the islands formed in the Kaveri River are consecrated to Sri Ranganathaswamy, and large temples have been built in very ancient times dedicated to that deity on the three largest islands. These three towns, which constitute the main pilgrimage centers dedicated to Ranganathaswamy, are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adi Ranga - at Srirangapatna&lt;br&gt;Madhya Ranga - at Shivanasamudra&lt;br&gt;Antya Ranga - at Srirangam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Famous Around:&lt;br&gt;The town is famous for a very ancient temple dedicated to Sri Ranganathaswamy, a form of Lord Vishnu. There is also Kalyani Siddhi vinayaka temple in front of the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. Other temples in Srirangapatna include the Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple,Jyothi Mahaswara Temple, Bidhcotta Ganesha Temple, Panduranga Swamy Temple, the Sathyanarayana Swamy Temple, the Anjunaya Swamy Temple, the Ayyapa Temple, the Gangadhareswara Swamy Temple, and RaganathaNagara Ganesha Temple,Lakshmi Temple, Sri raghavendra swamy mutt on old post office road, surrounding Srirangapatna in fort 8 Ganesh &amp;amp; Anjunaya temples. The Karighatta (Black Hill) and its temple of Lord Srinivasa is situated a few kilometres from the town. The deity is that of Kari-giri-vasa (one who resides on the black hill). The renowned Nimishambha Temple is located about 2 km from the town. Srirangapatna also hosts the summer palace of Tipu Sultan and his mausoleum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The presence of the Kaveri River is in itself considered auspicious and sanctifying. The Paschima Vaahini section of the Kaveri at Srirangapatna is considered especially sacred; the pious come from far and wide to immerse the ashes of the departed and perform obsequies to their ancestors in these waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hyder and Tipu:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Srirangapatna became the de facto capital of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. When Tipu finally dispensed with the charade of deference to the legitimate Wodeyar Maharaja who was actually his captive, and proclaimed the Khudadad State under his own kingship, Srirangapatna became de jure the capital of this just and ably managed kingdom.

As mentioned earlier the first palace was built during 14th century by the then Wodeyar kings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysuru Palace is one of the most magnificent buildings. It is a sight not to be missed when it is illuminated on Sundays and festive occasions. The interior of the Palace is equally worth a visit, for its spacious halls, paintings and architectural beauty. The palace is an excellent combination of Indo-Saracenic architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The palace you see at Mysore is probably the third or the fourth generation of the palatial structure built over this location by the ruling dynasty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many reasons , including the shift in power and other catastrophes caused the destruction of older citadels.","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"25/08/2016-01:36:45 PM","modified_date":"04/10/2016-10:40:02 AM"},{"placeid":"2594285c2bc0b2f2","title":"Chamundeshwari Temple, Chamundi Hills.","galleries":[{"id":33,"img_name":"2594285c2bc0b2f2-0-chamundeshwari temple pics.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/2594285c2bc0b2f2-0-chamundeshwari temple pics.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/2594285c2bc0b2f2-0-chamundeshwari temple pics.jpg"},{"id":34,"img_name":"2594285c2bc0b2f2-1-Chamundi Mahishasura 2.JPG","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/2594285c2bc0b2f2-1-Chamundi Mahishasura 2.JPG","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/2594285c2bc0b2f2-1-Chamundi Mahishasura 2.JPG"},{"id":35,"img_name":"2594285c2bc0b2f2-2-nandi-statue-chamundeshwari-temple-mysore.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/2594285c2bc0b2f2-2-nandi-statue-chamundeshwari-temple-mysore.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/2594285c2bc0b2f2-2-nandi-statue-chamundeshwari-temple-mysore.jpg"},{"id":439,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-0-17BG_CHAMUNDI_1621687f.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-0-17BG_CHAMUNDI_1621687f.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-0-17BG_CHAMUNDI_1621687f.jpg"},{"id":440,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-1-28bgd_heritage_MYR_1066831g.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-1-28bgd_heritage_MYR_1066831g.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-1-28bgd_heritage_MYR_1066831g.jpg"},{"id":441,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-2-29bgd_chamundi_GO0_1221709g.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-2-29bgd_chamundi_GO0_1221709g.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-2-29bgd_chamundi_GO0_1221709g.jpg"},{"id":442,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-3-Climbing-Chamundi-Hill-by-road.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-3-Climbing-Chamundi-Hill-by-road.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-3-Climbing-Chamundi-Hill-by-road.jpg"},{"id":443,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-4-HillView.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-4-HillView.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-4-HillView.jpg"},{"id":444,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-5-ORR11.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-5-ORR11.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-5-ORR11.jpg"},{"id":445,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-6-road.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-6-road.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-6-road.jpg"},{"id":446,"img_name":"14bad0a9a8e0fc99-7-Temple complex, facing east.JPG","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-7-Temple complex, facing east.JPG","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/14bad0a9a8e0fc99-7-Temple complex, facing east.JPG"}],"tag_words":"Temples, Holy Place, Hill, Nandi Temple, Mahishasura","address":"Chamundi Hill Rd, Mysuru, Karnataka 570010","lati":"12.275255","longi":"76.670147","ratingstar":5,"nearkm":"12.4","nearestplace":"Nandi Statue\r\nJwalamukhi Temple\r\nView Point\r\nMahishasura Statue","details":"The Chamundeshwari Temple is located on the top of Chamundi Hills about 13 km from the palace city of Mysore in the state of Karnataka in India. The temple was named after Chamundeshwari or Durga, the fierce form of Shakti, a tutelary deity held in reverence for centuries by Mysore Maharajas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chamundeshwari Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha and one among the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas. It is known as Krouncha Pitham as the region was known in Puranic times as Krouncha Puri.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original shrine is thought to have been built in the 12th century by Hoysala rulers while its tower was probably built by the Vijayanagar rulers of the 17th century. In 1659, a flight of one thousand steps was built leading up to the 3000 foot summit of the hill. At the temple are several images of Nandi (the bull mount of Shiva). There is a huge granite Nandi on the 800th step on the hill in front of a small Shiva temple a short distance away. This Nandi is over 15 feet high, and 24 feet long and around its neck are exquisite bells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chamundi Hills&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Named after goddess Chamundi, the Chamundeshwari Temple sits atop the main hill. The main hill itself features an ancient stone stairway of 1,008 steps leading to its summit. Approximately halfway to the summit is statue of bull Nandi, the vahana, or vehicle of Lord Shiva, which is 4.9m tall and 7.6m long and carved out of a single piece of black granite. Around this point, the steps become significantly less steep and eventually the climber is rewarded with a panoramic view of the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Temple has a quadrangular structure. A key feature is the statue of Mahishasura bearing a sword in his right hand and a cobra in the left. Within the temple's sanctum stands a sculpted depiction of Chamundeshwari. She is seated with her right heel pressed against the lowest of the seven chakras. This cross-legged yogic posture echoes the posture of Lord Shiva. Worshipers believe that this powerful yogic posture, if mastered, provides an added dimensional view of the universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the early days of the Maharajahs of Mysore, the idol of goddess Chamundi has been carried on a decorated elephant as part of the celebrations in the annual Dusshera festival.&lt;br&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"23/08/2016-11:11:03 AM","modified_date":"04/10/2016-10:40:31 AM"},{"placeid":"6aa7d05474d91fd9","title":"Mysuru Zoo","galleries":[{"id":31,"img_name":"6aa7d05474d91fd9-0-mysore_zoo_giraffe.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/6aa7d05474d91fd9-0-mysore_zoo_giraffe.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/6aa7d05474d91fd9-0-mysore_zoo_giraffe.jpg"},{"id":32,"img_name":"6aa7d05474d91fd9-1-Mysore_Zoo-16.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/6aa7d05474d91fd9-1-Mysore_Zoo-16.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/6aa7d05474d91fd9-1-Mysore_Zoo-16.jpg"},{"id":433,"img_name":"0f3bfe6821e74fa5-0-green-anaconda-at-mysore-zoo.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-0-green-anaconda-at-mysore-zoo.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-0-green-anaconda-at-mysore-zoo.jpg"},{"id":434,"img_name":"0f3bfe6821e74fa5-1-mysore_zoo_giraffe.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-1-mysore_zoo_giraffe.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-1-mysore_zoo_giraffe.jpg"},{"id":435,"img_name":"0f3bfe6821e74fa5-2-Mysore-Zoo-11.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-2-Mysore-Zoo-11.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-2-Mysore-Zoo-11.jpg"},{"id":436,"img_name":"0f3bfe6821e74fa5-3-mysore-zoo-16.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-3-mysore-zoo-16.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-3-mysore-zoo-16.jpg"},{"id":437,"img_name":"0f3bfe6821e74fa5-4-Mysore-Zoo-Mysore.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-4-Mysore-Zoo-Mysore.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-4-Mysore-Zoo-Mysore.jpg"},{"id":438,"img_name":"0f3bfe6821e74fa5-5-P1080082.JPG","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-5-P1080082.JPG","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/placesintrest-images/thumbnails/0f3bfe6821e74fa5-5-P1080082.JPG"}],"tag_words":"Animals, Birds, Reptiles,","address":"Zoo Main Road, Indiranagar,, Mysuru, Karnataka 570010","lati":"12.301786","longi":"76.664033","ratingstar":4,"nearkm":"2.3","nearestplace":"Mall of Mysuru\r\nExhibition Ground\r\nMysuru Palace\r\nJaganmohan Palace and Arts Gallery\r\nRailway Museum","details":"Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, popularly known as &lsquo;Mysore Zoo&rsquo;, is one of the oldest zoos of the country established in 1892, by His Highness, the erstwhile Ruler of Mysore Sri Chamarajendra Wadiyar Bahadur.

It was constructed in 1936 using a Neo Gothic style and its architecture was inspired by the Cologne Cathedral in Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;History&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A church at the same location was built in 1843 by Maharaja Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. An inscription which was there at the time of laying the foundation of the present church in 1933 states: In the name of that only God - the universal Lord who creates, protects, and reigns over the universe of Light, the mundane world and the assemblage of all created lives - this church is built 1843 years after the incarnation of Jesus Christ, the Enlightenment of the World, as man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1926, Sir T. Thumboo Chetty who was the Huzur Secretary to the Maharaja of Mysore, Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar obtained a relic of the Saint from Peter Pisani, Apostolic Delegate of the East Indies.[1] This relic was handed over to Father Cochet who approached the king to assist him in constructing a church in honour of St. Philomena. The Maharaja of Mysore laid the foundation stone of the church on October 28, 1933. In his speech on the day of the inauguration, the Maharaja is quoted to have said: The new church will be strongly and securely built upon a double foundation &mdash; Divine compassion and the eager gratitude of men. The construction of the church was completed under Bishop Rene Feuga's supervision. The relic of Saint Philomena is preserved in a catacomb below the main altar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This church is a good example of blending of local culture. Some of the female statues are dressed with local traditional dress, Saree.&lt;br&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"23/08/2016-10:50:44 AM","modified_date":"04/10/2016-10:41:28 AM"}]
