This temple was built in the 12th century AD around the same time as the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura, Mysore district.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before the Krishna Raja Sagara dam project was conceived by Sir M.Visvesvaraya in 1909, the temple complex was located in the village of Kannambadi. The KRS Dam project meant that Kannambadi and other surrounding settlements would be submerged. The then king of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV ordered the construction of a new village for the residents of Kannambadi and aptly named it Hosa Kannambadi (New Kannambadi).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, the Venugopala Swamy temple complex and 2 other temples namely Kenneshwara (Ishwara) temple and Kalamma (A local deity) temple had to be abandoned. By 1930, the first phase of the dam was completed and all three temples were submerged.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The main idol of Venugopalaswamy, Lord Krishna playing on flute as a cow-herd, was shifted to a new temple in the rehabilitated village before the submersion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The original temple complex was massive, with an area of around 50 acres (20 ha) 100 by 60 yards (91 m &times; 55 m).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The complex was a symmetrical building enclosed by two 'prakaras' and the outer gate (Mahadwara) had verandahs on both sides, flanked by the yagasala and the kitchen. This was enclosed by the second mahadwara, which led to the inner enclosure and was akin to the Somanathapura temple.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The temple had a garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), a vestibule, a middle hall and a mukhya mantapa (main hall). The cell opposite to the entrance had a figure of Kesava (Lord Krishna) and the south cell, containing the figure of Gopalakrishna, was a later addition&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When the KRS dam was conceived in 1909, the temple was condemned for submersion. By 1930, the entire erstwhile village of Kannambadi was completely buried underwater. However, the temple would resurface whenever the water levels in the reservoir dropped, typically during drought years. This was most evident around the year 2000.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For more than 70 years the temple lay underwater, when the Khoday Foundation under the guidance of liquor baron and philanthropist Mr. Sri Hari Khoday took up the task of relocating and restoring the temple. It was initially planned to shift the entire complex to Madhuvana Park in Mysore. However, protests from the villagers of Hosa Kannambadi convinced the foundation to shift it to a place near the rehabilitated village. The cost of the project was estimated to be around â‚¹ 2.5 crore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The new site is about one km to the north of the original site; the backwaters would touch the outer walls of the temple if the water level of the KRS touched 124.80 ft, its maximum capacity. It is 9 km by road from Brindavan Gardens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The in-house architects of the group had shot the original temple on video, taken over 16,000 photographs, and marked each and every slab used in the construction of the original temple. Each and every temple stone was removed and reconstructed at Hosa Kannambadi with trained artisans and sculptors, with half a dozen experts from Tamil Nadu also involved in the reconstruction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As of December 2011, the temple restoration has been completed, but is awaiting an official inauguration.

The place is also known as Thirunarayanapuram. It is built on rocky hills, known as Yadugiri, Yaadavagiri and Yadushailadweepa, overlooking the Cauvery valley. Melukote is about 51 km (32 miles) from Mysore and 133 km (83 mi) from Bangalore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Melukote is the location of the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, with a collection of crowns and jewels which are brought to the temple for the annual celebration.

The utsavamurthi, which is a metallic image, represents the deity who is called Shelvapillai, Cheluva Raya and Cheluvanarayana Swamy, whose original name appears to have been Ramapriya (meaning Ramas Favourite). It is believed that this utsavamurthi belonged to and was worshipped by Lord Rama and the kings of the surya vamsa Dynasty for generations. Later the same deity was given to a king of Chandra vamsam (the dynasty of Lord Krishna) and was worshipped by Lord Krishna and many generations. So CheluvaNarayana is so unique that he was worshipped by both Rama and Krishna.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to a legend, this metallic image was lost and was recovered by Sri Ramanujacharya. The annual report of the Mysore Archeaelogical Department (p. 57) states on the strength of epigraphic evidence, that the presiding deity of this temple was already a well-known object of worship before Sri Ramanujacharya worshipped at the shrine, in December 1098, and even before he came to the Mysore region.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The temple is richly endowed, having been under the special patronage of the Mysore Rajas too, and it has a most valuable collection of jewels in its custody. As early as 1614, the Mysore king Raja Wodeyar (1578&ndash;1617) who first acquired Srirangapatna and adopted the Srivaishnava faith, handed over to the temple and the Brahmins at Melkote, the estate granted to him by Vijaynagar king Venkatapati Raya. On one of the pillars of navaranga of the Narayanaswami temple is a bas relief about 1.5 feet (0.46 m) high, of Raja Wodeyar, standing with folded hands, with the name inscribed on the base. He was said to be a great devotee of the presiding deity and a regular visitor to the temple. A gold crown set with precious jewels was presented by him to the temple. This crown is known as the Raja-mudi, after his name. From the inscriptions on some of the gold jewels and on gold and silver vessels in the temple, it is learnt that they were presents from Krishnaraja Wodeyar III and his queens. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III also presented a crown set with precious jewels. It is known after him, as Krishnaraja-mudi. Vairamudi or Vajramukuta, another crown of great value, seems to be older than Raja-mudi and Krishnaraja-mudi.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All the three crowns are kept in the safe custody of the Government at Mandya Treasury and brought to the temple on a specific annual occasion known as Vairamudi which literally means The Diamond Crown for adoring the image of Cheluvanarayana Swamy. The Vairamudi festival, which is the chief annual celebration, is attended by more than 400,000 people. Jatras are held annually during March&ndash;April and more than one lakh people congregated here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1785, Tipu Sultan gave some elephants to the temple.[citation needed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A number of inscriptions and records of the place speak of the land grants and gifts to this shrine.

Home to thousands of monks from Tibetan origin as well as Indian origin, it is tucked away amidst the Coorg Mountains and provides plenty of picturesque sceneries for the visitors.

Initially, the monastery was constructed with the help of Bamboo and had spanned about 80 sq feet. Gradually, more architectural designs and building structures were added to the monastery complex. His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama consecrated the monastery and gave the present name of the monastery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Architecture&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bylakkuppe is a settlement which owes its origin to the monastery and consists of two parts, one which was established by Lugsum Samdupling in 1961 and the other one was set up in 1969 by Dickyi Larsoe. But the Namdroling Nyingmappa Monastery is the main structure in this beautiful surrounding, having picturesque setting all around. Architectural beauty of this monastery is evident from the moment one enters through the two large red doors, which have carvings in gold and plenty of mural works. These paintings are works of Tantric Buddhism. Statues present inside the temple are quite attractive as well as huge and these three statues are placed on a platform and have gold plaiting. In the centre is the statue of Buddha, which is about 60 ft tall, while the statues of Amitayush and Padmasambhava are in the flanks with 58 ft height. There are two thrones, one of which has a framed photograph of Dalai Lama, decorated with incense and candles and flowers. Tibetan prayer flags are seen adorning the trees inside and outside the monasteries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As part of the architectural brilliance, there are mural paintings on the walls and ceilings. There paintings represent the demons and mythological characters with some showing dragons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Inside the monastery settlement, there are living blocks for the monks and nuns and a religious college known as Shedra, as well as a hospital. The temple is known as Padmasambhava Buddhist Vihara or Golden Temple by the locals. The tip of the monastery buildings and stupas are having gold plating, which shine due to the reflections from the sun. Nunneries were established in 1993. About 150 rooms are present for the monks and nuns to stay and complete their education.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Festivals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A number of festivals and ceremonies are held every year in the monastery. The one which is visited by lots of tourists and monks is the Tibetan New Year or Losar, which is according to the Tibetan Lunar Calendar. These usually fall in the months of February and March. There are Lama dances in the traditional forms and the monastery is decorated with Thangka hanging from the sides of the buildings. Processions are also an integral part of these celebrations, which are usually held in the monastery grounds, continuing for about 2 weeks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Prayers are held every day in the mornings and evenings and these are the things to watch and perceive, as they give a soothing effect to the mind and soul.&lt;/div&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"27/09/2016-06:20:55 PM","modified_date":"29/09/2016-03:36:27 PM"},{"placeid":"6648251d8361381f","title":"History of KRS Dam ","galleries":[{"id":347,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-0-30BG_NARAYANAPURA__2029014f.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-0-30BG_NARAYANAPURA__2029014f.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-0-30BG_NARAYANAPURA__2029014f.jpg"},{"id":348,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-1-2005110906630301.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-1-2005110906630301.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-1-2005110906630301.jpg"},{"id":349,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-2-2011040554160301.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-2-2011040554160301.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-2-2011040554160301.jpg"},{"id":350,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-3-dp_spillway2.JPG","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-3-dp_spillway2.JPG","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-3-dp_spillway2.JPG"},{"id":351,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-4-dp_spillway3.JPG","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-4-dp_spillway3.JPG","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-4-dp_spillway3.JPG"},{"id":352,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-5-great-personalities-related-to-science-24-638.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-5-great-personalities-related-to-science-24-638.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-5-great-personalities-related-to-science-24-638.jpg"},{"id":353,"img_name":"6648251d8361381f-6-hqdefault.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/6648251d8361381f-6-hqdefault.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/6648251d8361381f-6-hqdefault.jpg"}],"tag_words":"Dam","address":"Krishna Raja Sagara, Krishnarajasagara, Karnataka 571607","lati":"12.425476","longi":"76.572438","ratingstar":4,"nearkm":"20.7","details":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dam was built across river Kaveri, the life giving river for the Mysore and Mandya districts, in 1924[citation needed].

It is the official residence and seat of the Wodeyars the rulers of Mysore, the royal family of Mysore, who ruled the princely state from 1399 to 1950. The palace houses two durbar halls (ceremonial meeting halls of the royal court) and incorporates a mesmerizing and gigantic array of courtyards, gardens, and buildings. The palace is in the central region of inner Mysore, facing the Chamundi Hills eastward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysore is commonly described as the City of Palaces. There are about seven palaces inclusive of this; however, Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the Old Fort. Built by the Maharaja Rajarshi His Highness Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV, Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, and has more than 6 million visitors annually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Royal Lineage&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV (Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar was Maharaja from 1799 to 1868. After the death of Tipu Sultan he made Mysore his capital in May 1799 and focused on education, religious sites and donating jewels to temples including Melkote. Chamaraja Wodeyar IX was crowned on September 23, 1868, at the age of five. He was anointed king on the date fixed by the Governor-General. He is credited with founding India's first democratic institutions with the Mysore representative assembly in 1881. Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV was Maharaja from 1895 to 1940 He was also called the Saint King by Mahatma Gandhi. Assisted by dewans Sir M. Visvesvaraya and Sir Mirza Ismail, he changed Mysore by adding Asia's first hydro electric project at Shivanasamudra, the KRS dam and the University of Mysore in 1916. Jayachamaraja Wodeyar was the twenty fifth and the last king, reigning from 1940 to 1950, when he agreed to merge the state with the union of India. A musicologist and a philanthropist, he was named Raj Parmukh of Mysore from Jan 26, 1950, a post he held for six years. The present Maharaja is Yaduveer Wadiyar, who was adopted by his aunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysore&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;King Yaduraya first built a palace inside the Old Fort in Mysore in the 14th century,which was demolished and constructed multiple times. The regent of Mysore, Her Majesty Maharani Vani Vilas Sannidhna, and her son, the Maharaja of Mysore His Highness Rajarshi Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, commissioned the British architect Lord Henry Irwin to build a new palace to replace the old one which had been turned into ashes by fire.[2] Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the nearby Jaganmohan Palace.&lt;br&gt;Construction of the current palace was commissioned in 1897, completed in 1912,[3] and expanded around 1940 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall wing) during the reign of His Highness Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, the last Maharaja of Mysore Kingdom. The construction was completed in 1912, but the fort continued to be beautified and its inhabitants were slowly moved to the newer extension built off the palace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysore Palace view from the south gate&lt;br&gt;Apart from the leonine Mysore Palace and Jaganmohan Palace (which, later, His Highness Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar used as his art gallery and it remains an art gallery), the city has several other grand palaces like Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion (now a folk art museum), Rajendra Vilas Mansion (now a private hotel atop Chamundi Hills), Lalitha Mahal Palace (now a five-star hotel), Laxmi Vilas Mansion, Cheluvamba Vilas Palace (the palace which His Highness Maharaja Sri Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar donated to the newly born Govt. of India; now the headquarters of Central Food Technological Research Institute, a national research institute), and Krishnarajendra Vilas Palace (now Krishna Rajendra Hospital). Besides there are buildings a century old or more, like Crowfard Hall (now the headquarters of the University of Mysore), Oriental Research Institute building, Corporation Complex of Mysore City Corporation, et cetera. In all the above palaces, the royal family holds blocks held by the kings traditionally. However, the Bangalore Palace and Mysore Palace are entirely under the possession of the royal family. Bangalore Palace remains entirely a private property of the princess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Architecture&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The architectural style of domes of the palace is commonly described as Indo-Saracenic and blends Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles. It is a three-story stone structure with marble domes and a 145 ft five-story tower. The palace is surrounded by a large garden. The entrance gate and arch hold the emblem and coat of arms of the kingdom of Mysore, around which is written the kingdom's motto in Sanskrit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gallery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The palace has three entrances: the East Gate (the front gate, opened only during the Dasara and for VVIPs), the South Entrance (for public), and the West Entrance (usually opened only during the Dasara). In addition, there are numerous secret tunnels from the palace cellar leading to Srirangapatna, other palaces, and confidential areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unique rooms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Public Durbar Hall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visitors will first see imported French lamp stands in the corner representing Egyptian figurines, just before entering the Durbar Hall there is a life size statue of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV.

Cool marble floor, through colonnades of cusped arches supported by intricate and elaborately painted columns. Row upon row, creating an illusion of infinite corridors. Paintings decorate the walls on the right. There are images of gods, portraits of royal family and scenes form the great epic the Ramayana each painting has its own uniquely carved frame, each one perfectly created to suite its own niche. Large mirrors on the far walls offer multiple reflections of whatever scene is unfolding amidst the never-ending columns, paintings, gods, temples and city skyline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Private Durbar or Ambavilasa Palace&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was used by the king for private audience and is one of the most spectacular rooms. Entry to this opulent hall is through an elegantly carved rosewood doorway inlaid with ivory that opens into a shrine to Ganesha. The central nave of the hall has ornately gilded columns, stained glass ceilings, decorative steel grills, and chandeliers with fine floral motifs, mirrored in the pietra dura mosaic floor embellished with semi-precious stones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gombe Thotti (Doll&rsquo;s Pavilion)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entry to the palace is through the Gombe Thotti or the Doll&rsquo;s Pavilion, a gallery of traditional dolls from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The pavilion also houses a fine collection of Indian and European sculpture and ceremonial objects like a wooden elephant howdah (frame to carry passengers) decorated with 84 kilograms of gold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kalyana Mantapa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Octagonal shaped hall where all royal weddings, birthdays and ceremonial functions were celebrated.

There also four other subjects such as the birthday procession of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, Durga Pooja or Ayudha Pooja on the south wall of the Kalyanamantapa, the car festival of Goddess Chamundeshwari and the celebration of Krishna Janmastami on the western corridor. The painting representing Dasara festivities are based on actual photographs and executed during the years between 1934 and 1945.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stained-glass ceiling soars heavenward &ndash; a rich tapestry of peacock motifs and floral mandalas held in place by metal beams. The design of the glass and framework was created by the artists of Mysuru and manufactured by famous walter McFarlance Saracen Foundry in Glasgow, Scotland. Majestic chandelier, hangs low from the centre of the tall dome, the peacock design is reflected in the mosaic tiles on the floor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outside columns carvings with scenes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana the two great Hindu epics of Ancient India. Electricity came to Mysuru in 1906. Palace was completed in 1912. There&rsquo;s been electricity since the first day the royal family moved in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portrait Gallery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many valuable paintings as well as the Photographs of the Royal Family are exhibited in the portrait gallery on the southern part of the Kalyana Mantapa. Wadiyar dynasty paintings and photographs are on display. Portrait of Krishnaraja Wadiyar the fourth, was a king with great vision and an extraordinarily generous patron of arts.

Painting of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV just one year old, sits on pram with his two older sisters. The portrait gallery is proud to exhibit two works of the famous Royal Artist Raja Ravivarma dated in 1885.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CASKET ROOM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Mysuru kings visit various parts of the state, their subjects received them with the greatest respect. They often had many requests, these would be formally submitted in small silver and sweet-smelling sandalwood caskets. Additionally they would present the kings with mementoes of their visit in these boxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sandalwood is one of the earliest items of trade, and its oil has been used in perfumes for over 4000 years. Sandalwood is believed to be scented by the gods. Its sacred properties mean its traditionally used to carve images of deities and create prayer beads. Seventy per cent of Indian sandalwood comes from the tropical forests of Karnataka and a diminishing resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temples inside Mysuru Palace Fort&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kodi Bharravasvami Temple &ndash; dedicated to Shiva in the form of Bhairava derives its name because of its location in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Lakshmiramana Swami Temple &ndash; Oldest temple in the city. Located towards the western part of the fort, inside the Palace. An inscription found in Cole&rsquo;s Gardens (present day Bannimantap) registers a Grant for God Lakshmiramana in 1499 AD. According to the annals of the Mysuru Royal Family, a half blind Brahim was cured his blindness around the year 1599 at the interposition of Raja Wadiyar. The temple is also important as all the religious ceremonies in connection with coronation of child Raja Krishnaraja Wadiyar III were held in this temple on June 30, 1799.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Trinayaneshvara Swami Temple &ndash; Ancient temple which existed even before the time of Raja Wadiyar, located outside the Original Mysuru fort, on the bank of Devaraya Sagar (Doddakere). It was during the time of Kanthirava Narasaraja Wadiyar and his successor Dodda Devaraja Wadiyar that the fort was enlarged and the Trinayaneshvara temple came within the fort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Prasanna Krishanswami temple &ndash; The Mysuru dynasty claims its descent from Yadu Vamsa (Yadu Race) founded by Sri Krishna of Mahabharata. Therefore, Krishnaraja Wadiyar III felt sad that there was no temple dedicated to Krishna. To fulfil this lacuna, he started the construction of Sri Prasanna Krishna Temple in 1825 and according to inscription, it was completed in 1829.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kille Venkatramana Swamy Temple &ndash; During the time of Tipu, the Mysuru family was still in Srirangapatna. Queen Lakshmammanni, wife of Krishnaraja Wadiyar II was deeply worried about the dynasty and its future. Then lord Venkataramana is said to have appeared in her dream, and directed her that his statue which is in Balamuri should be consecrated in Mysuru. By this pious act, her dynasty would get salvation. She therefore, proceeded to Balamuri without the knowledge of the Sultan and brought the image of Venkataramana, consecrated it in the temple, and offered continuous worship. This is said to have helped the family and after the fall of Tippu, the Kingdom was restored to the Wadiyar dynasty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Bhuvaneshwari Temple &ndash; located on northern side of the Palace Fort corresponding to the Varahaswamy temple in the south, thus providing a symmetrical structure in the fort complex. Constructed by Sri Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar in the year 1951. One of the important objects in the temple is a copper Surya Mandala which is said to have been transferred from the Palace to this temple by His Highness Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Gayatri Temple &ndash; located in the south-east corner of the fort directly corresponding to the Trinayaneshara swamy temple constructed by Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar in 1953. Three shrines dedicated to Savithri, Gayathri and Saraswathi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Special events&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every autumn, the Palace is the venue for the famous Mysuru Dasara festival, during which leading artists perform on a stage set up in the palace grounds. On the tenth day of the festival Vijaya Dashami, a parade with caparisoned elephants and other floats originate from the palace grounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dasara is the most extravagant festival of Mysuru. The Dasara festival is celebrated in the months of September and October of each year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The festival celebrates and commemorates the victory of the great goddess Durga, after she slew the demon, Mahishasura, and thereby, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil according to Hindu mythology. Some call her Chamundeshwari.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This festival has been celebrated by the Wadiyars at Srirangapatna from 1610 and in Mysuru with great pomp from 1799 and the tradition still is carried on although the scale of the celebrations has diminished. The Dasara festivities have become an integral part of the culture and life in Mysuru.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To celebrate this festival the Palace of Mysuru is illuminated with more than 96,000 lights during that two month period.&lt;br&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"31/08/2016-11:16:31 AM","modified_date":"29/09/2016-12:42:53 PM"},{"placeid":"b439598ee941f582","title":"Silver Jubilee  Clock Tower","galleries":[{"id":179,"img_name":"b439598ee941f582-0-Dodda Gadiyara-1.jpg","img_path":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/b439598ee941f582-0-Dodda Gadiyara-1.jpg","img_thumbnails":"http://iluvmysuru.in/assets/historygeography-images/thumbnails/b439598ee941f582-0-Dodda Gadiyara-1.jpg"}],"tag_words":"Dodda Gadiyara Mysore","address":"Dodda Gadiyara, Ashoka Rd, Devaraja Mohalla, Mandi Mohalla, Mysuru, Karnataka 570001","lati":"12.309802","longi":"76.655880","ratingstar":4,"nearkm":"1","details":"he Silver Jubilee clock tower was built in 1927 to commemorate the silver jubilee (25 years) of the rule of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, the maharaja of Mysore.

The splendid cultural heritage contrary to the city majestically echoes in the fascinating tourist attractions, that consist of panoramic palaces to religious attractions, exceptional gardens, glorious festivals and also extremely colorful crafts. Mysore will unquestionably get hold of most of the hearts and minds of travelers and tourists through the beginning. Mysore is almost certainly among the captivating holiday destinations of South India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mysore is located at 12.30&deg;N 74.65&deg;E and has an average altitude of 770 metres (2,526 ft).[22] It is spread across an area of 128.42 km2 (50 sq mi)[2]:4 at the base of the Chamundi Hills in the southern region of Karnataka. Mysore is the southern-most city of Karnataka, and is a neighbouring city of the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south, flanked by the state cities Mercara, Chamarajanagara, and Mandya. People in and around Mysore extensively use Kannada as medium of language. Mysore has several lakes, such as the Kukkarahalli, the Karanji, and the Lingambudhi lakes. In 2001, total land area usage in Mysore city was 39.9% residential, 16.1% roads, 13.74% parks and open spaces, 13.48% industrial, 8.96% public property, 3.02% commercial, 2.27% agriculture and 2.02 water.[23]:35 The city is located between two rivers: the Kaveri River that flows through the north of the city and the Kabini River, a tributary of the Kaveri, that lies to the south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mysore has a tropical savanna climate designated Aw under the K&ouml;ppen climate classification. The main seasons are summer from March to June, the monsoon season from July to November and winter from December to February.[22] The highest temperature recorded in Mysore was 39.4 &deg;C (103 &deg;F) on 4 April 1914, and the lowest was 7.7 &deg;C (46 &deg;F) on 16 January 2012.[24][25] The city's average annual rainfall is 804.2 mm (31.7 in).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The political history of Mysore and Coorg (1565&ndash;1760) is the political history of the contiguous historical regions of Mysore state and Coorg province located on the Deccan Plateau in west-central peninsular India (Map 1). It begins with the fall of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 and ends just before the rise of Sultan Haidar Ali in 1761.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the height of the Vijayanagara Empire (1350&ndash;1565), the Mysore and Coorg region was ruled by motley chieftains, or rajas (little kings). Each raja had dominion over a small area, and each supplied soldiers and annual tribute for the empire's needs. Soon after the empire's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family, many chieftains, especially in the west, tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms. Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty, various powers from the north invaded the region intermittently. Among these were the Sultanate of Bijapur to the northwest, the Sultanate of Golconda to the northeast, the fledgling Maratha empire, farther northwest, and the Mughal empire, farther north still. For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers, and amongst the little kings, resulted in shifting sovereignties, loyalties, and borders. By the turn of the 18th century, the political landscape had become better defined. The northwestern hills were being ruled by the Nayaka rulers of Ikkeri, the southwestern, in the Western Ghats, by the Rajas of Coorg, the southern plains by the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore, all of which were Hindu dynasties; whereas the eastern and northeastern regions were being ruled by the Muslim Nawabs of Arcot and Sira. Of these, Ikkeri and Coorg were independent, Mysore, although much expanded, was formally a Mughal dependency, and Arcot and Sira, Mughal subahs (or provinces).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The stability, however, was not to last. Mysore's expansions had been based on unstable alliances. When the alliances began to unravel, as they did during the next half century, political decay set in, presided over inevitably by pageant kings. The Mughal governor, Nawab of Arcot, in a display of the still far-flung reach of a declining Mughal empire, raided the Mysore capital, Seringapatam, to collect unpaid taxes. The neighbouring Raja of Coorg began a war of attrition with Mysore over western territory. Soon, the Maratha empire invaded again and exacted more concessions of territory. In the chaotic last decade of this period, a little-known Muslim cavalryman, Haidar Ali, seized power in Mysore. Under him, in the decades following, Mysore was to expand again. It was to do so prodigiously to match in size southern India itself. It was also to pose the last serious threat to the new rising power on the subcontinent, the English East India Company.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A common feature of all large regimes in the region during the period 1565&ndash;1760 is increased military fiscalism. This mode of creating income for the state consisted of extraction of tribute payments from local chiefs under threat of military action. It differed both from the more segmentary modes of preceding regimes and the more absolutist modes of succeeding ones&mdash;the latter achieved through direct tax collection from citizens. Another common feature of these regimes is the fragmentary historiography devoted to them, making broad generalizations difficult.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","status":"1","post_by":"admin","post_date":"25/08/2016-12:42:19 PM","modified_date":"29/09/2016-12:43:16 PM"}]
